    "ai": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing a persistent cold that's been bothering you for two weeks. As Tryambakam, I'll try to offer some helpful insights and suggestions to alleviate your discomfort.\n\nBefore we proceed, please keep in mind that I'm not a substitute for a qualified medical professional. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nThat being said, a cold that lasts for two weeks can be caused by a variety of factors, such as:\n\n1. **Viral infections**: Colds are usually caused by viruses like rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, or adenoviruses. These viruses can take time to clear up, and some may linger longer than others.\n2. **Allergies**: Allergies can masquerade as a cold, especially if you're allergic to something in your environment, like dust, pollen, or pet dander.\n3. **Sinus infections**: Sinus infections can cause cold-like symptoms, including congestion, runny nose, and coughing.\n4. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to cold temperatures, dry air, or pollution can exacerbate cold symptoms.\n\nConsidering your symptoms have persisted for two weeks, here are some potential remedies and suggestions:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal teas, or warm soup, to help thin out mucus and soothe your throat.\n2. **Rest and relaxation**: Get plenty of rest to help your body recover from the infection. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n3. **Saline nasal sprays**: Use a saline nasal spray to moisturize your nasal passages and loosen mucus.\n4. **Warm compresses**: Apply a warm compress to your face to loosen mucus and ease sinus pressure.\n5. **Humidify the air**: Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help relieve congestion and coughing.\n6. **Gargle with salt water**: Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and gargle several times a day to soothe your throat.\n7. **Consider over-the-counter medications**: Over-the-counter medications like pain relievers, decongestants, or antihistamines may help alleviate your symptoms. However, always follow the recommended dosage and consult with your doctor before taking any medication.\n\nIn addition to these remedies, I'd like to ask a few questions to better understand your situation:\n\n* Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, body aches, or difficulty breathing?\n* Have you tried any medications or remedies already?\n* Do you have any underlying health conditions or allergies that might be contributing to your symptoms?\n\nPlease feel free to share any additional information that might help me provide more tailored guidance."

Is that still the case, or have your symptoms changed or worsened since then?\n\nTo confirm, you're experiencing a combination of symptoms such as:\n\n* Runny nose\n* Congestion\n* Coughing\n* Sore throat\n* Fatigue\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong or if your symptoms have evolved. I'm here to help and provide guidance to the best of my abilities.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with your actual healthcare provider for personalized medical advice and diagnosis. I'm just here to offer helpful insights and suggestions to alleviate your discomfort."
