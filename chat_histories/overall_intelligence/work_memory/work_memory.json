    "ai": "You have a review tomorrow where you'll be discussing your final year project in detail. That can be a bit nerve-wracking, but with some preparation, you'll feel more confident and ready to showcase your work.\n\nAs Tryambakam, I'd like to help you prepare for your review. Can you tell me a bit more about your final year project? What's the topic, and what were your goals and objectives?\n\nHere are some questions to consider as you prepare for your review:\n\n1. **Project overview**: Can you briefly summarize your project, including its title, objectives, and scope?\n2. **Methodology**: What methods and approaches did you use to complete your project? Be prepared to explain your design decisions, data collection methods, and any relevant tools or technologies you used.\n3. **Key findings**: What were the main results or findings of your project? Be prepared to discuss any data, trends, or insights you uncovered.\n4. **Challenges and limitations**: What challenges did you face during the project, and how did you overcome them? Are there any limitations or areas for future improvement?\n5. **Conclusion and recommendations**: What conclusions can be drawn from your project, and what recommendations do you have for future work or applications?\n\nAs you prepare to discuss your project, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Practice your presentation**: Rehearse your presentation several times to ensure you stay within the allotted time frame and cover all the key points.\n2. **Use visual aids**: Prepare any visual aids, such as slides, diagrams, or charts, to help illustrate your points and make your presentation more engaging.\n3. **Anticipate questions**: Think about potential questions your reviewers might ask and prepare responses in advance.\n4. **Show enthusiasm and confidence**: Demonstrate your passion and knowledge about your project, and be confident in your abilities and findings.\n\nTo help you feel more prepared, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n* What is the format of the review? Is it a presentation, a meeting, or a written report?\n* Who will be attending the review? Are they experts in your field, or will they have a more general understanding of your project?\n* What are your goals for the review? Are you seeking feedback, approval, or funding?\n\nPlease feel free to share any additional information about your project and the review, and I'll do my best to help you prepare and feel more confident."
