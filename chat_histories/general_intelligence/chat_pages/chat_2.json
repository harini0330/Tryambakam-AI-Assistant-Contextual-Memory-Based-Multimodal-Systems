Here's an example:\n\n```\n# Function to add multiple numbers\ndef add_numbers(*args):\n  return sum(args)\n\n# Get the numbers from the user\nnumbers = input(\"Enter the numbers separated by space: \")\nnumbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = add_numbers(*numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of the numbers is\", result)\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
